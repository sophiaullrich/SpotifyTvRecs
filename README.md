The Spotify TV Recommender is a personalized web application that bridges the gap between music preferences and TV show recommendations. By leveraging Spotify's API, the platform analyzes a user's listening history to identify favorite genres, artists, and moods, then cross-references this data with curated TV show databases to suggest shows that align with the user's musical tastes.
