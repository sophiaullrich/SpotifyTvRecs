Spotify TV Recommender
Spotify TV Recommender is a personalized web application that recommends TV shows based on your Spotify listening history. By analyzing your favorite genres, moods, and artists, the app suggests shows that align with your musical taste — combining your love for music and binge-worthy series in a unique and intelligent way.

How It Works

Analyze Listening History: The app uses the Spotify Web API to fetch your top tracks, genres, and artists.

Match to TV Shows: Based on your audio preferences, the app maps them to curated TV show themes and genres using an internal recommendation algorithm and external TV show data sources.

Show Suggestions: Receive real-time TV show recommendations tailored to your music taste.
